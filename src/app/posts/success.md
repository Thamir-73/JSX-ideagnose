I recently visited Cuba, and realized somethings that changed the structure of my beliefs on success, in so many ways.

Since the country is really different in every way possible, from how people conduct their daily life, and also on the possibilities that lie in front of people.

And differences are always the things that give us the most realizations.

And I am not saying this only as an abstract belief, 

it had profound consequences on practical things that I’ve undertook in life.
 

See the usual image of success is that it’s really a preassigned mark that we need to hit, 

whether it’s the business we operate, or the job we want, or what have you.

but this outlook on success is one that really doesn’t do it complete justice, as we’ll see.

### The Relativistic View of Success:

So I call this mainstream view of success laid above:

the relativistic approach/view of success, 

in which we set a specific relative goal/s, so attaining financial goals, or what have you, 

and we only consider it a success, or more broadly consider ourselves “successful” if we hit that specific mark that we preassign for ourselves,


but the problem with this outlook on success, <b>on its own</b>, is that there’s a tunnel vision that comes with setting those preassigned goals <b>in the future</b>, 
& defining our success based on them, 


(don’t get me wrong there are many benefits in doing that, but hold on tight, we’re only outlining its limits for now),

which is that it makes us, in many occasions, <b>over-</b>prioritize the future, and forget or set on the background, many other things, including the present moment,

and on top of this, humans always have to constantly battle with themselves to live in the present, anyways, because a calamity in the future is always possibly peaking at us,

so this also makes the over-embeddedness in the future even more severe.

So that’s the first issue with regards to that relativistic view of success.

The other problem with this outlook is that it could drain all your energy in the case of a huge downfall or a failure on the road, to that “success” or “goal”,

because that condensed point of failure of trying to “succeed” or be successful, 
could drain your energy like an off-switch, 

if not achieved very specifically at a specific point in time, in the way it’s in your mind.

and that off-switch is not necessarily something you can articulate or detect consciously as soon as it happens, 

it could be what people call “burn-out” nowadays or whatever else…

And again, don’t get me wrong at this point, 

this relativistic view of success, is not an all-together “bad” thing,

as we’ll further see in this exploration, 

but we’re just outlining the limitations with it for now, 

to later present our more holistic view that will balance things,  in the exact right amount hopefully, 

which also includes <b>some</b> of the good aspects of the relativistic, as we’ll see.


### The Absolute lens of Success:

But after presenting some limitations on the predominant view on success, 

how can success possibly be anything other than “achieving” what we aim for?

The secret is in the question itself… 
<b>Aiming</b>.

So this leads me into what I call the absolute lens of success;

We skip and brush over an important aspect of success, in that relativistic lens we laid above, 

which is: the privilege of the 

<b>ability</b> to try & aim infinitely, 


in the first place.

There’s a realm where the ability <b>to try</b> to even achieve what we want, is even unplausible, 

which makes its existence, a success in and of itself.

And so the ability to try & to have optionality, if you truly internalize it, is half of the road to success, 

and being able to alternate and being aware of this mindset, is really the crux of the absolute lens, I am presenting here.

and it’s absolute in the sense that it doesn’t matter what your goals are, it’s always there in you hands.

Now you may think, how would this practically add to us anything?

Or to be more specific, how would this solve the issues we presented above, on the relativistic lens making us too & overly-grounded in the future, rather the present, 

and also, it not giving us a protective capacity against failure, to get back up?

Well, if the focus is on the trials, we become more grounded in the present, since it shifts our focus to the horizons of the optionality that’s in our hands, 

and gives us a sense of intellectual awareness to internalize the capacity & ability of trying, 

rather than being fixated on something very specific in the future, which would make us skip over many things in the present, and keep us on autopilot on things that lie outside the bounds of very specific future goals.

And the absolute lens is obviously not sufficient on its own, 

it has to be coated and complimented by the relativistic sense, to be exactly done the right way.

The chaos needs to be there with the order. Not either one on its own…

And also, if that’s really not convincing enough to incorporate the absolute lens, yet,

the absolute lens, will also endow us with a backbone that kind of gives us more anti-fragility and allow for a thicker skin against failures, across the road, 

as failures are definitely inevitable.

rather than solely relying on hitting a specific mark, which any major turbulence on, 

would cause all sorts of anxieties that keeps us jaded from the experience of life. 
They’re both important, focusing on the specific mark, and focusing on the optionality, and we have to hold them both, at the same time, and this serves as a reminder to the less emphasized aspect of it.

There is something to be said with how it’s more important for “succeeding”,

to know how to deal with failure, than it’s to know how to exactly “succeed”. 
(I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out).

And this is really why I am presenting this absolute lens, along with its relativistic lens.

You see, people will always focus on succeeding, and the recipe to success, etc., 

but to be honest, the single most important thing to succeed, 

is to be able to get back up from failure, because it’s way more common to fail along the way, than it’s to succeed.

and this point of view, that includes some of the absolute lens of success, mixed with the some of the relativistic lens, endowes us with that anti-fragility that’s needed against failure,

instead of the relativistic lens on its own, which would more often than not, put us in a position to have less capacity to deal with failures, in that sense.

### The balance:

Now someone could throw their hands and say, will what do we do now since we are always & already “successful”?

Well… Don’t take it too far friend, 

we have to also keep the relativistic view on our side, stacked on top of the absolute lens.

The reason we present this outlook is to maximize the benefits of the relativistic view, not necessarily replace it.

There is a success in your hands, and you have to be aware of it to have more energy, anti-fragility, awareness & excitement towards the world, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only success there is to be, and you need to throw your hands in the sky, now.

The relativistic lens is great, if it could be balanced with something like being aware of the structure that gives rise to it in the first place (i.e. the ability to try).

They are lenses for a reason, you can essentially keep them as your two lenses in some sense, alternating between them.

### Alt-ego thoughts/Conclusion:

I want reflect why I’ve really written this, because there’s something to be said with how you might think all of this might be wrong, 

ok fair enough..

But I really want to present where I am coming from, with this,

perhaps you can extract an insight, even if you think everything I said about success is wrong.

Ok, so,

A lot of concepts get very much accepted by people because of how much those concepts enabled people, which is amazing & great,

but 1 critical question to ask is,

how much those concepts pulled-back, other people?

“Aim for excellence”, 


my god, great & amazing advice, it’s great in every way possible,

but my alt-ego really really wonders, 

how much did this make so many other people afraid of taking the first step, because of the burden of thinking they can’t reach “excellence”, 

because of how unbearably limited/impostors, we think of ourselves, in the beginnings…


So “Aim for excellence” is such a great advice, don’t get me wrong,

but maybe, just maybe…
a maximally beneficial concept to distribute to society as a whole, would be: 

“Aim for a functional next step”…

to account for more variability in human psychology…

rather than,

“Aim for excellence”

That former one, would, I would say, 
by proxy lead to a pool of excellence too, 

since all you need, to cultivate excellence in society is to make exceptional people start, that’s it…

it’s in them to strive for excellence, if they actually start.

So maybe something that accounts for more people benefiting themselves and society, and also extracts excellence in society, 

would be that idea.

And so trying to maximally extract benefits out of that concept in that way, whether about success or otherwise, 

is what I’ve been playing with, in this essay, too.
