“Language is quite a limitation to what human reason can reach”,

or, 

“Putting it into words is limiting it”,

is something we quite hear a lot from academics, and general people alike, 

But let’s really look at what language does, in the most fundamental sense, to understand, later, is it really indeed a “limitation” to our cognition?

(whatever the hell that question means. Let’s just assume we grasp it at the first instance, because let’s not make a mistake that we can spend a whole book just trying to wrap our heads around the question itself)

So In one sense, it’s obviously a tool for communication, peer-peer, which is what most people focus on when they think about language,

but actually, the purpose of language is not communication,   Yes... You read it right..

In many other ways, language is also a right hand for attention & reflection itself.

If you think about it, everything about our cognition & attention is piecemeal, meaning we think in pieces, & step-by-step.

We don't & can't drink the whole water jug all at once, we divide it into glasses, bit by bit. 

It's built into the structure of our attention.

So in that sense, language comes along and gives us a tool to experience that gradualism 

as our attention tries to unravel & express itself into the world, and really understand it.


Another perhaps indirect purpose/consequence of language that is usually swept under the rug too, is that:

It also serves towards poking certain untapped experiences in the complexity of the human mind, it’s mind-expansive. The process of humans generating language is emergent & inherently unpredictable.

(it’s not the only tool to do that, but there seems to be a major human consensus that speaking or writing just gives you new insights left & right, that you just can’t quite get to, through other routes).

And It seems like with language, it gives us a tension that is the exact right amount to tap into constant unexplored territory in our psyche.

So even when removing any social aspect of language, language literally produces new thoughts as it’s being instantiated.

So now that we sorted out some general purposes/consequences of language, let’s get one part of it, straight in our heads:

The world without language is <b>not</b>incomprehensible. which is a huge misconception people tend to ascribe to it, especially, when thinking about the second purpose laid above (language being a right-hand to attention).

There are countless animals that have fully functional cognition, without any access to language, 

crows, whales, you name it.

In that sense, this shows us that, even with our purposes in place, language is not necessary, or sufficient for cognition. 

Let’s not get that wrong before moving on.


However…, an analogy that could in a sense help us unravel this unbelievably complex dynamic, is that,

language to cognition, is like fixing a mildly low thyroid hormone problem, 

the patient doesn’t realize the benefits they’re missing out on with a deficient hormone, 

until you replenish the hormone for them, then they experience a refreshed part of them that they never knew was there.

Same with language & cognition, 

cognition “thinks” it doesn’t necessarily need language (which in a sense, is true as we said), until it’s provided with it, then it becomes more important, in a sense.

### Answering the question:

So is language indeed a limitation to our cognition?

My initial intuition to this question, is that it’s a limit that unlimits [if you know what I mean :) ](https://www.ideagnose.com/blog/natureofcon). 

yeah, long-time OG readers know I just never give simple answers, folks, we are not here for the “simple” answers.

Ok, so

There’s something to be said with how much an explosive number of irrelevant things, would be incorporated in our thoughts & “communication”, 

had we didn’t have something like structured language.

Why?

well, this goes back to the point of our attention being piecemeal, 

our thoughts are <b>not as gradual as our attention</b>, but language is, 

so in many ways, language fills the gap between gradual attention, & racing thoughts, between the order and chaos, we could also say. 

Yes there will be some thoughts cut-off in the process of linguistic articulation, but can’t we claim that it’s creative destruction (not always), in so many ways?

There’s nothing that necessitates the destruction of certain thoughts in a process, being counterproductive to cognition.

So, in some ways the explosion of ideas that would happen, without language lurking in the back and watching over our backs, 

is probably “freeing” or unlimiting, in some ways, fair enough, we’ll take that,

but perhaps, “freeing” in a bad and “lost in the desert”, type of way.

Think of the analogy of an already built street with a way to go about your wanted destination, Vs being in a desert stranded and trying to get somewhere,

maybe the street is more “limited/limiting”, but that limit “unlimits” you, in the sense that it takes you from point a to b,


without being lost and scratching your head in loss, all the time (like in the desert).

I mean you’re “free” to go in any direction in a desert, 

but that “freedom” is “limiting” in some very profound way (It’s sooo weird folks I know, I know, take a “second” to grasp this idea, I’ve been thinking about it for almost like a year, almost every single day, non-stop, and haven’t reached any of its depths yet).

So in a deep paradoxical way, language is something that’s perhaps “limiting” in some quantitative way (directs your thoughts “somewhere” / out of the desert),

but what it eventually does is unlimit, as we saw in the example of the desert.


Now, Let’s challenge ourselves a bit. Everything we said can’t be taking all angles into consideration.

Ok, so there’s something to be said with how this tool (i.e. language) could be a double-edged sword.

I mean sometimes language is also used to limit people, all the time, unnecessarily.

Take propaganda as an example, it’s the use of language to inhibit people from reaching true conclusions, and that can’t be what we we’re talking about above, no?

Well in that sense, language is limiting, let’s take that as a nuance or caveat to what we said, that’s very good to think about,

but the claim we’re trying to put forward above is that language is not limiting, <b>in principle</b>.

It might be used in a certain way that limits certain critical thinking capabilities or what have you,

but the tool doesn’t necessarily do that, in principle.


### Thought experiment:

Let’s put things aside a bit, I want to tackle the question from another angle in some ways, in the form of a thought experiment, 

and also, again, challenge my previous conjectures from an angle.
Ok,

So a lot of people would pose that if we imagine that brains directly communicate through, say, direct brain impulses, 

without needing the intermediary of language being actualised in verbal, textual, etc. form,
that would be optimal, and “less limiting” to the human cognition and progression, in many ways.

Now that challenges, in a semi-indirect way, our view that language is not actually “limiting” to cognition. 

Because It’s essentially saying that a direct brain impulse connection would “improve” the problem of “language limitation”, 

which we are trying to say is not a problem, in principle.

Well, let’s deal with this great point.

I don’t accept the premise that “communication” would be easier and “better” or would allow for more human progression, 

if brains had direct impulses connection without the constraint of language,

Which kind of reiterates/brings back to our points above, so be patient if we are repeating ourselves sometimes, but I think it’s good to tackle things from different angles.

I think that, as soon as that direct impulse happens, an explosion of communication “noise”, would occur. 

There’s something to be said to how language suppresses the infinite noise (noise relevant to the context), that is present in our minds.

I mean allowing for more communication through brain impulses or what have you, would be too much in many ways, 

and that would literally, at least will be capable, to drown all the important things, that are conveyed through communication.

and as we said in 1 of our purposes, communication is not something that’s waiting there to be communicated, it emerges on the spot as we do it 
(weeiiiird stuff, but it’s true).


Also, The time limit that is inherent to language makes this noise explosion less likely. 

it allows us to remove more of the noise from whatever is running in our minds, almost by its nature. 

We can give direct impulses 24/7, 

but we can’t talk 24/7, and that is a limit that unlimits us as humans in so many ways.

And another perhaps personal opinion is that, 

I personally think I wouldn’t be able to “communicate” with a direct brain impulse,

because I literally don’t know what I am really thinking, until I am discussing with someone through the constraint of language. It’s emergent in every way possible as far as I see it.

### Conclusion:

I hope I didn’t end up confusing you with all sorts of ideas,

I guess if we are trying to summarize our answer to the question, 

we could say that in some profound way, language is a constraint in all sorts of domains,

but it’s one that breaks all sorts of other constraints. (Think about it and let me know if it’’s a good summary of what I’ve been saying)

We also saw that obviously it’s a tool that could be used as a tool of manipulation in all sorts of direction, 

but I believe we have to think about tools, in principle, and in exhaustive practicalities.

It just makes more sense to do that at least as an initial step.

### Limitations towards my view / areas for criticism:

I have a sense that I messed many important aspects of the discussion because a lot of people disagree with me on my conclusions,

so I want to open up a space for people to challenge me, 

You can start with looking for, where I messed saying, why, I think certain things.

Sometimes I tend to give statements without proper clear justification because of my intuition.

So there’s definitely room for criticism there, and in many different parts of the essay, feel free to do that.
